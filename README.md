## Notes
[1] The URL for data fetching (`DATA_URL` in `MainActivity.java`) is my local network address, to test this, you need to change this as  per your network configurations and device running state (either emulator or physical device)
<br>
[2] I added **Title** and **Author's name** to the **description** provided by the API, added as markdown and then displayed it as parsed markdown in the video's details.<br>
[3] I used Volley for API data fetching, Markwon for markdown parsing and Exoplayer for video player.
